Thermal Analysis of Combined ORC & VCR Cycle Using EES
This repository contains the complete project files for the thermal analysis of a Combined Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) and Vapor Compression Refrigeration (VCR) system using Engineering Equation Solver (EES).

📄 Project Overview
This project investigates the recovery of waste heat from a diesel engine’s exhaust and cooling water by integrating an ORC and VCR system. The mechanical power generated by the ORC directly drives the VCR compressor, enabling efficient combined power generation and refrigeration.

📁 Repository Contents
Project Report: Detailed documentation of system design, methodology, analysis, and results.

EES Program Files: Source codes for thermodynamic modeling and simulations.

Excel Files: Data sheets for calculations, parametric studies, and performance comparisons.

🚀 Key Features
Working Fluids Analyzed: R600 (Butane), R600a (Isobutane), R1234ze, R1234yf.

Parametric Studies: Boiler pressure, condenser temperature, and evaporator temperature.

Performance Metrics: Overall Coefficient of Performance (COP) and mass flow rate per kW of cooling (MKW).

Safety & Environmental Considerations: Comparison of fluids for thermodynamic efficiency, safety, and environmental impact.

🌟 Highlights
R600 achieved the highest thermodynamic performance (max COP, lowest MKW).

R600a is recommended for practical use due to lower flammability and greater availability.

R1234ze and R1234yf are less suitable for this application due to lower COP and higher MKW.

Performance Trends:

Increasing boiler pressure improves COP up to near-critical pressure.

Higher condenser temperatures reduce COP and increase MKW.

Higher evaporator temperatures increase COP and decrease MKW.
